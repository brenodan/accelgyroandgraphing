This application was created as a project for the Mobile Applications class at Notre Dame.

It showcases some basic uses of the gyroscope/accelerometer embedded on an iPhone as well as how to graph this data.

This app has two simple tabs: Data and Graph.
As is evident by the tab labels, the Data tab holds the labels for the acceleration and rotation in all X, Y, and Z directions. The acceleration is read from the accelerometer while the rotation from the gyroscope. The Graph tab, on the other hand, plots this same data in a bar chart. Thus, what the bar chart demonstrates is the changing values in each of these aspects.

Here are a couple of useful resources we utilized when making this application:

-- "Swift tutorial: Core Motion (Accelerometer/Gyroscope)" - a youtube tutorial on how to retrieve the accelerometer and gryoscope data

-- "How to use iOS Charts API to Create Beautiful Charts in Swift" - a guide to using the iOS-charts-library (note that the full project in this guide is written in an outdated version of Swift and will require updates).
